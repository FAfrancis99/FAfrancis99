### 💻 Projects

- ⚽ **FIFA World Cup Outcome Prediction**  
  Applying machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes using historical data and team statistics.

- 🌲 **Pepse Project**  
  Developed a 2D procedurally generated game with dynamic terrain, day-night cycles, and an interactive player avatar using Java.

- 🧬 **CBIO Hackathon - Predicting Antibiotic Resistance**  
  Developed machine learning models to analyze genomic patterns and predict antibiotic resistance. Utilized logistic regression, SVM, and random forest algorithms with k-mer frequency features. Visualized performance metrics using ROC curves and feature importance graphs.  

- 🤖 **AI Final Project - Can't Go Back Game**  
  Designed and implemented multi-agent search algorithms to optimize iRobot performance in a competitive room-cleaning task. Utilized Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning and Q-Learning for adaptive decision-making.
